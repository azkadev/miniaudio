If you have a question about how to use the library, please read the documentation at the top of miniaudio.h and take a look at the examples. If that still doesn't answer your question, consider posting in the miniaudio subreddit at [r/miniaudio](https://www.reddit.com/r/miniaudio) or in the Discussions section here on GitHub instead. Otherwise, feel free to post your issue and we'll get to it as soon as possible.

If you have an issue with playback, please run the simple_playback_sine example first and check whether or not that is working. Likewise for capture, please run the simple_capture example. If these examples work, it probably (but not always) means you're doing something wrong and a question in the subreddit or the Discussions section is more appropriate.
